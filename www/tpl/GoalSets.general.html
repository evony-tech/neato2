			<p>This will load your goals in ever-increasing specificity.</p>
			<p>If you have a goalset with server, username and city name blank, it'll return that.</p>
			<p>After that, it'll return a row with the server set but everything else blank. This
			lets you have a server-specific set of goals that overrides the full global.</p>
			<p>After that, it'll return a row with server and username (email) set so you can have
			a set of goals specific to that one account on that one server.</p>
			<p>After that, it'll return a row with the server, username AND city so you can
			have a set of goals specific to that particular city in that account, on that server.</p>
			<p>Use the script below in EACH AND EVERY
			city you want to load global goals.</p>
			<p>You do not need any of the above levels.  I'd suggest at least the global so every
			city will get SOMETHING but it's not truly necessary.</p>
